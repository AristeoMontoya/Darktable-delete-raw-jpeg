# Remove RAW + JPEG
A very hacky script to delete both RAW imported images and jpegs that are not imported into darktable

## Why?
Let's say you went on vacations and now have a week worth of photos, chances are that a handful of those are useless (out of focus or straight garbage), so there's no reason to keep a copy of those photos (not even jpegs), so this scripts attempts to do that with a click of a button

## How?
Witchery and bad practices.
